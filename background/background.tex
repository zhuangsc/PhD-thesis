\chapter{Background}
\label{chap:background}

The readers benefit from an understanding regarding the state-of-the-art and 
the current challenges presented in the field of parallel computing and deep 
learning in order to grasp the works carried out from this thesis.
This chapter prepares the reader with the acquaintances of the various forms of 
modern parallel systems and the task-based programming paradigm for such systems. 
This chapter subsequently presents an introduction to the two application domains
this work deals with, namely, parallel numerical algorithms and DNNs.
